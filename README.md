# LPWAN for Smart Agriculture

## Overview
This project is a **Senior Capstone Project (Spring 2025, NJIT)** focused on building a **Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)** for smart agriculture disaster detection.  
The system integrates IoT sensors with a simulated LPWAN backbone in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to provide real-time alerts for hazards such as:

- Wildfires  
- Floods  
- Wildlife intrusions  

The design demonstrates how farmers can leverage energy-efficient, long-range networks to protect crops, livestock, and infrastructure in remote farming environments.

## Features
- Wide-area monitoring using LPWAN concepts  
- IoT Sensors: temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, fire monitors  
- Automated Fire Safety: fire detection, sprinkler activation, and manual override  
- Near real-time alerts to a central IoT server  
- Basic security controls (encryption, access restrictions)  
- Scalable and modular design for multi-zone farms  

---

## Tech Stack
- Cisco Packet Tracer – Network & IoT simulation  
- IoT Devices – Humidity, soil moisture, fire, and motion sensors  
- Python SBC Script – Automated fire detection and control logic  
- LoRaWAN/LPWAN Concepts – Modeled under Packet Tracer constraints  
- Documentation & Design – Reports, diagrams, presentations

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Install **Cisco Packet Tracer** (version 8.2 or higher recommended).  
2. Open the file:  
3. Explore the following components:
- IoT Gateways, Fire and Humiture monitors, Soil Moisture sensors  
- Automated Sprinkler and Emergency Button logic  
- IoT Server at the farmhouse network  
4. Trigger events (such as fire sensor activation) and observe the automated sprinkler system response.  
5. Review reports and presentation slides in the repository for detailed explanations.
